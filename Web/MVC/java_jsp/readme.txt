JSP is a technology that is used for creating dynamic web pages that are executed on the server-side. With JSP, you can embed Java code in HTML pages to create dynamic content. JSP is a part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform and is often used for creating web applications that run on a Java web server.

Angular, on the other hand, is a client-side JavaScript framework used for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs). Angular is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and provides developers with a powerful set of tools for building complex and interactive web applications.

One of the main differences between JSP and Angular is that JSP executes on the server-side, while Angular runs on the client-side. With JSP, the web server generates HTML pages that are then sent to the client's web browser. In contrast, Angular generates HTML pages on the client-side, in the user's web browser.

Another difference between JSP and Angular is their approach to building web applications. JSP is typically used for creating traditional server-rendered web applications, where each page request results in a full page reload. Angular, on the other hand, is used for building SPAs that provide a more seamless user experience by dynamically updating the content on the page without requiring a full page reload.

Overall, JSP and Angular are both powerful tools for building web applications, but they are used in different contexts and for different purposes. JSP is a server-side technology used for building traditional web applications, while Angular is a client-side JavaScript framework used for building modern SPAs.
