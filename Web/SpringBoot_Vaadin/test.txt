Why use Vaadin instead of Spring MVC and Thymeleaf, JSP or
Freemarker?
Vaadin is an alternative to using Spring MVC and Thymeleaf, JSP or Freemarker when
building web applications with Spring Boot.
The main advantage of Vaadin are:
• Vaadin is designed for building interactive single-page apps (SPA). Spring MVC and
templates are better suited for more static content.
• Vaadin offers a Java component API, allowing you to build the entire application in
Java.
• Vaadin comes with a large library of customizable UI components.
• Vaadin handles the communication between the server and the browser
automatically, you don’t need to write any JavaScript to update content dynamically
